# scDynaBar

Project Description

scDynaBar is an innovative approach that combines CRISPR-Cas9 dynamic barcoding with single-cell sequencing to record temporal cellular events. Over a 4-week period, genetic barcodes accumulate mutations, which are then sequenced together with the transcriptome of each single cell. This enables the creation of a time-ordered record of cellular events, providing a unique perspective on biological dynamics.

In this study, we applied scDynaBar to track the transition from a pluripotent state to a two-cell (2C)-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our results demonstrate the transient nature of the 2C-like state. Additionally, we show consistent mutation rates across different cell types in a mouse gastruloid model, underscoring the robustness and versatility of the system across diverse biological contexts.
